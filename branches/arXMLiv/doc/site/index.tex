\title{\LaTeXML\ \emph{A \LaTeX\ to XML Converter}}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

%============================================================
The \emph{Current release} is \htmlref{\CurrentVersion}{download}.

In the process of developing the
\href{http://dlmf.nist.gov/}{Digital Library of Mathematical Functions},
we needed a means of transforming
the LaTeX sources of our material into XML which would be used
for further manipulations, rearrangements and construction of the web site.
In particular, a true `Digital Library' should focus on the \emph{semantics}
of the material, and so we should convert the mathematical material into both
content and presentation MathML.
At the time, we found no software suitable to our needs, so we began
development of LaTeXML in-house.  

In brief, \texttt{latexml} is a program, written in Perl, that attempts to
faithfully mimic \TeX's behaviour, but produces XML instead of dvi.
The document model of the target XML makes explicit the model implied
by \LaTeX.
The processing and model are both extensible; you can define
the mapping between \TeX\ constructs and the XML fragments to be created.
A postprocessor, \texttt{latexmlpost} converts this
XML into other formats such as HTML or XHTML, with options
to convert the math into MathML (currently only presentation) or images.

\emph{Caveats} This is still a \emph{preview release} of LaTeXML.
It isn't finished, there are large gaps in the coverage,
particularly in missing implementations of the many useful \LaTeX\ packages.
But is beginning to stabilize and interested parties
are invited to try it out, give feedback and even to help out.


%============================================================
\section{Examples}\label{examples}
At the moment, the best example of \LaTeXML's output is 
the \href{http://dlmf.nist.gov/}{DLMF} itself
--- the preview  will soon contain several chapters.
It is perhaps not a fair example, in that there is much
special-purpose processing to generate cross-referencing and metadata that is not
part of LaTeXML by default. Nevertheless, it gives an indication of the
math conversion and other features possible.

\section{Installation}\label{install}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\LaTeXML\ itself is written in `pure' Perl, but requires several
perl modules available from CPAN or your OS distribution.
Some of the modules provide Perl bindings to libraries
written in C or C++, and thus require those libraries to have been installed.
A recent \href{http://www.perl.org/}{Perl}
with sufficient Unicode support is required: version 5.8 or later.

The following additional Perl modules are required:
% %3A%3A for :: ???
\begin{description}
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Parse::RecDescent&mode=module}{Parse::RecDescent}]
    A useful grammar based parser module.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Image::Magick&mode=module}{Image::Magick}]
    This module provides bindings to the \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/}{ImageMagick} library.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=XML::LibXML&mode=module}{XML::LibXML}]
    This module provides bindings to the C library libxml2
    (available from \href{http://www.xmlsoft.org}{xmlsoft}.
    At least version 1.61 is required, unless the separate \texttt{XML::LibXML::XPathContext}
    package is installed (but it is not standard in many distributions).
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=XML::LibXSLT&mode=module}{XML::LibXSLT}]
    This module provides bindings to the C library libxslt
    (from \href{http://www.xmlsoft.org}{xmlsoft},
%  <li><tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=XML::LibXML::XPathContext&mode=module">XML::LibXML::XPathContext</a></tt>
%      Depends on the XML::LibXML module.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=DB_File&mode=module}{DB\_File}]
    This module is usually part of a standard Perl installation, provided
    \href{http://www.sleepycat.com}{BerkeleyDB} is installed.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Test::Simple&mode=module}{Test::Simple}]
    This module is usually(?) part of a standard Perl installation.
\end{description}

\subsection{From Source}
Assuming that all the required C packages are already installed on your system,
  use CPAN to install the required perl modules (typically as root):
\begin{alltt}
   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   install Parse::RecDescent, XML::LibXML, XML::LibXSLT, DB_File
   quit
\end{alltt}
The \texttt{Image::Magick} module often installs best by enabling the
perl bindings as part of compiling and installing the main ImageMagick package.

Installation proceeds via the usual Perl module incantations:
\begin{alltt}
   tar zxvf  \CurrentTarball\\
   cd LaTeXML-\CurrentVersion\\
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
\end{alltt}
and then, as root:
\begin{alltt}
   make install
\end{alltt}
(See \texttt{perl perlmodinstall} for more details, if needed.)


\subsection[RPM-based systems]{RPM-based systems (Fedora, RedHat, CentOS)}
For Fedora (and perhaps other similar) distributions, 
after you've dowloaded the LaTeXML RPM, the following
command should install LaTeXML along with any missing prerequisites:
\begin{alltt}
   yum localinstall \CurrentRPM
\end{alltt}

Unfortunately, more conservative distributions
(such as RedHat Enterprise and CentOS)
do not have recent enough releases of the prerequisites available.
I am working on a workaround for this problem.
% \begin{alltt}
%    yum install perl-Parse-RecDescent  \textbackslash\\
%      ImageMagick ImageMagick-perl  \textbackslash\\
%      libxml2 perl-XML-LibXML libxslt perl-XML-LibXSLT \textbackslash\\
%      perl-Test-Simple
% \end{alltt}

\subsection{Debian-based systems}
For Debian based distributions, presumably including Ubuntu, the following
command  should install the prerequisites:
\begin{alltt}
   sudo apt-get install   \textbackslash\\
      libparse-recdescent-perl \textbackslash\\
      libxml2 libxml-libxml-perl \textbackslash\\
      libxslt1.1 libxml-libxslt-perl  \textbackslash\\
      imagemagick perlmagick
\end{alltt}
You can then continue by installing LaTeXML from source, as above.

Some \href{http://rhaptos.org/devblog/reedstrm/latexml}{notes} on installation on Debian
based systems are also available.

\subsection{MacOS}
Many of the prerequisite packages are available via `fink' (I think).
You can then continue by installing LaTeXML from source, as above.

\subsection{Windows}
Many of the prerequisite packages are available in
ppm form (for \href{ActivePerl}{http://activestate.com/} (I think).
I will attempt to generate a ppm for LaTeXML in the near
future, depending on user interest --- and assistance!

%============================================================
\section{Documentation}\label{docs}
If you're lucky, all that should be needed to convert
a \TeX\ file, \textit{mydoc}\texttt{.tex} to XML, and
then to XHTML+MathML would be:
\begin{alltt}
   latexml --dest=\textit{mydoc}.xml \textit{mydoc}
   latexmlpost -dest=\textit{somewhere/mydoc}.xhtml \textit{mydoc}.xml
\end{alltt}
This will carry out a default transformation into XHTML+MathML.  If you
give the destination extension with html, it will generate HTML+images.

If you're not so lucky, or want to get fancy, well \ldots dig deeper:
\begin{description}
\item[\href{manual/index.xhtml}{LaTeXML Manual}]
    Overview of LaTeXML (\href{manual.pdf}{\PDFIcon}).
\item[\href{manual/commands/latexml.xhtml}{\texttt{latexml}}]
    describes the \texttt{latexml} command.
\item[\href{manual/commands/latexmlpost.xhtml}{\texttt{latexmlpost} command}]
   describes the \texttt{latexmlpost} command for postprocessing.
\end{description}

% But, it doesn't have anything in it yet.
