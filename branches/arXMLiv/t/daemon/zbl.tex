\beginreview
The author proposes an algorithm which, for a given in the net $G=(V,E)$ $\,S$-$T$-flow $f\: E\to R_+$, allows to construct the flow expansion into the sum $S\times T$ of flows between all possible streams of flows for the time $O(\vert E\vert (2+\log(\vert V\vert ^2/\vert E\vert )))$ (when the powers of sets $S$ and $T$ are considered to be fixed). These flows are integral-valued, if the initial flow $f$ is integral-valued.
