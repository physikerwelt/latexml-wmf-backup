This directory contains an XSLT stylesheet for the conversion of LaTeX papers to DocBook with MathML. 

To use it run latexml and then latexmlpost --pmml --nocrossref --noscan --novalidate
(i.e. generate presentation MathML) and then run ltx2docbook.xsl over it. 

CAVEAT: the stylesheet has only been tested on one paper (TNTBase for BALISAGE) and
developed only to a state, where it was easier to do the rest of the tweaking manually
than develop the stylesheet further, so your milage may vary.

 But maybe this inspires someone from the group to develop this further.
