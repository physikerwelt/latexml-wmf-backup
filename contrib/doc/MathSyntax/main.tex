\chapter{Introduction}
In this study, we survey the notational diversity of present-day mathematical expressions, in order to uncover its linguistic phenomena.
\section{Motivation}
We want to enable machine-reading of formulas, in order to provide a variety of user-assistance services, such as semantic search, text-to-speech synthesis, semantic interactions (definition lookup), as well as computer algebra support (``evaluate subexpressions on demand'') and ultimately computer verification (``does that proof step really hold?'').\ednote{expand}
\section{Related Resources}
Notation census, beginnings of study are in Deyan's thesis, Naproche and FMathL have examples, but no real systematic study.\ednote{expand}

\section{Experimental Setup}
The primary corpus on which we base this investigation is the Cornel pre-print archive ``arXiv''\ednote{cite here}, consisting of over 700,000 articles in 37 scientific subfields.

As a secondary resource, we we will also consult entry-level literature on highschool mathematics, in order to exhibit basic phenomena, as well as to demonstrate phenomena apriori known to the authors
