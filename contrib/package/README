This is the area of packages contributed to LaTeXML, it is intended as a rough equivalent to CTAN. 
Some of this material may eventually end up in the LaTeXML distribution if it is mature enouth.

README:    this file
lib: 	   auxiliary files (make, packages, utilities)
Makefile:  automation (only on POSIX system I am afraid)
<else>:    contributed packages

The contributed packages consist of LaTeXML bindings of existing or new packages with LaTeXML bindings.
For the latter we recommend to use the LaTeX workflow to self-documenting packages and have the bindings 
in the same *.dtx file (see the webgraphic package for an example). The Makefiles here give an automated 
build procedure and prepare inclusion into CTAN.
