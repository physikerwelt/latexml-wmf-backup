Description: TeX and LaTeX to XML translator
 For many, LaTeX is the prefered format for document authoring,
 particularly those involving significant mathematical content
 and where quality typesetting is desired. On the other hand,
 content-oriented XML is an extremely useful representation for
 documents, allowing them to be used, and reused, for a variety
 of purposes, not least, presentation on the Web. Yet, the style
 and intent of LaTeX markup, as compared to XML markup, not to
 mention its programmability, presents difficulties in converting
 documents from the former format to the latter. Perhaps ironically,
 these difficulties can be particularly large for mathematical
 material, where there is a tendency for the markup to focus on
 appearance rather than meaning.
 .
 The choice of LaTeX for authoring, and XML for delivery were natural
 and uncontroversial choices for the Digital Library of Mathematical
 Functions. Faced with the need to perform this conversion and the lack
 of suitable tools to perform it, the DLMF project proceeded to develop
 thier own tool, LaTeXML, for this purpose.
