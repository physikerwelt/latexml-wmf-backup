This directory contains an XSLT stylesheet for the conversion of LaTeX papers to DocBook with MathML. 

To use it run latexml and then latexmlpost --pmml --nocrossref --noscan --novalidate
(i.e. generate presentation MathML) and then run ltx2docbook.xsl over it. 

CAVEAT: the stylesheet has only been tested on one paper (TNTBase for BALISAGE), so your milage may vary.
