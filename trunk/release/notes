Steps for making a new release

 * Adjust $LaTeXML::VERSION in LaTeXML.pm
 * add an entry to Changes
 * make
 * doc/makemanual (pdf)
 * make distclean
 * perl Makefile.PL
 * make dist
 * make rpm
 * mv the tarball, cp the rpm, to /local/www/site/htdocs/LaTeXML/releases
 * doc/makesite


# Attempts to make a ppm/ppd:

need module: PPM::Make
apparently have to run as root, since it wants to write to /root/.cpan !?!?!?

make_ppm --skip --ppd=/home/bruce/tmp/ppm/ --ar=/home/bruce/tmp/ppm/ /home/bruce/latexml/LaTeXML-0.6.0.tar.gz


#======================================================================
Under fedora 9, cpan2rpm creates an rpm that puts everything
in /usr/local/...
rpmlint complains!

fedora docs suggest using cpanspec

cpanspec --noprefix --packager=Me LaTeXML-0.6.1.tar.gz

That generates a spec...
which suggests that 
  perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
might solve the above problem


rpmbuild -ba LaTeXML.spec

What does THIS mean????  "unpackaged" ???

RPM build errors:
    Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:
   /usr/bin/latexml
   /usr/bin/latexmlbib
   /usr/bin/latexmlfind
   /usr/bin/latexmlpost
   /usr/share/man/man1/latexml.1.gz
   /usr/share/man/man1/latexmlbib.1.gz
   /usr/share/man/man1/latexmlfind.1.gz
   /usr/share/man/man1/latexmlpost.1.gz

where does that leave me w.r.t. installing in texmf?

There are some docs about TeX installations on fedora
as well....
we need an appropriate, but agnostic, dependency on tex
use mklssomething instead of texhash
